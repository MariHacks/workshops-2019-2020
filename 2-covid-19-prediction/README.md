# 2-covid-19-prediction workshop

This program pulls data from [John Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), and performs data visualization and prediction.

To run code, type in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will run the code and create 2 files: `cases.png` with all the recorded COVID-19 cases in Canada and `predictions.png` with the model predictions of COVID-19 cases in Quebec.

To modify the code, search for comments with `# TODO` and follow the suggested instructions to customize the program.
