# 2-covid-19-prediction workshop

This program pulls data from [John Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), and performs data visualization and prediction.

**Files needed to run**: `main.py`, `graph.py`, `models.py` - the rest can be ignored

To run code, type in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will run the code and create 2 files: `cases.png` with all the recorded COVID-19 cases in Canada and `predictions.png` with the model predictions of COVID-19 cases in Quebec.

To modify the code, search for comments with `# TODO` and follow the suggested instructions to customize the program.

**Disclaimer**: The predictions in this program are only intended for experimental and educational purposes, and are in no way predictions that are considered valid or that should be used to make decisions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
