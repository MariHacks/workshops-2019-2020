#Workshops 2019-2020 

The code fron 2019-2020 workshops held by The Programming Club are uploaded in the folders in this repository.

There are 2 ways to execute the code: on Repl.it and locally on your computer.

## Running code on Repl.it

Copy all the files and their filenames from each sub-repository into a Repl.it environment. 

Run the code, it should work!


## Running code locally

**Installation**

1) Python

To run the code, (download Python)[https://www.python.org]. 

During installation, ensure that the installer configures environment variables.

2) Git

(Download and install Git)[https://git-scm.com/downloads].

3) Code Editor

Download and install a code editor. Some popular ones include Atom, Notepad++, and Sublime.


**Cloning the repository**

Using **Terminal** (MacOS, Linux) or **cmd** (Windows), navigate to the appropriate directory. 

(Guide for Terminal)[https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/introduction-terminal-navigation] - (Guide for cmd)[https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands]

To clone the repository, type in terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MariHacks/workshops-2019-2020.git
cd workshops-2019-2020
```


**Installing dependencies**

Python programs may require dependencies.

To globally install (simplest option but not always recommended), type in your terminal
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

It is preferable to install dependencies using virtual environments. The Python docs have (a guide for configuring virtual environments in Python)[https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/].


**Running Programs**

Refer to the `README.md` file in each sub-directory for instuctions.

If `python` keyword isn't recognized by your terminal prompt, it's likely that the environment variable isn't correctly configured. (This webpage)[https://www.educative.io/edpresso/err-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command] offers a possible fix for Python environment variable on Windows.
